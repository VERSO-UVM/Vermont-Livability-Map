    <h1>More about the Vermont Zoning Atlas</h1>
      <h3>Team</h3>
      <p>
        Inspired by Sara Bronin’s keynote speech at the 2022 Vermont Statewide Housing Conference, University of Vermont students Yoshi Bird and Michael Arnold approached the state and other partners about creating a dataset that could visualize geospatial distributions of land use regulations across Vermont down to the individual district level. Emily Sun, a planner from New York City and Middlebury graduate, volunteered as the founding Zoning Analyst Team Lead, supported by Dr. William Hegman of Middlebury College, while Colin Dowey, former of the Agency of Commerce and Community Development, acted as the consulting Geospatial Lead.

Key partners who provided additional staffing to organize and lead sub-teams included Kendall Fortney of the Vermont Open Source Research Office (UVM VERSO), Catherine Dimitruk of the Northwest Regional Planning Commission, and Leslie Black-Plumeau of the Vermont Housing Finance Agency. Significant funding for student interns was provided by the University of Vermont Geography and Geosciences Department, Gund Fund for the Environment, and College of Arts & Sciences Fellowship program.

In August 2024, the project officially transferred ownership to VERSO and the University of Vermont’s Open Source Programs Office under the leadership of Director Kendall Fortney, which will continue to coordinate the ongoing collection of a custom data subset in partnership with the Regional Planning Commissions, Town Planners, the Agency of Commerce and Community Development, and the Vermont Center for Geographic Information.
