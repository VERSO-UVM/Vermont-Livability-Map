ORCA creates these products through student project teams called Pods — groups of dynamic and passionate students who learn industry open source practices by working on real projects destined for public use. This program is run and funded by the University of Vermont Open Source Program Office (VERSO).

This effort is essential for supporting housing development, economic sustainability, and future community growth in alignment with Vermont’s settlement patterns. Without public infrastructure, new development is hindered, leading to a housing crisis and jeopardizing business retention. By systematically mapping existing wastewater infrastructure data and filling gaps, the project will help identify ideal locations for new development and inform strategic public investments. </p><p> Working with partners like VCGI and state agencies, UVM have been compiling and publishing this data, supporting both immediate development challenges and broader state goals for sustainable growth and resilience.

This innovative product, informed by high-resolution lidar data collected between 2013 and 2017, depicts the lateral extent of flooding for eight modeled storm sizes, ranging from 2 to 500-year recurrence intervals. Created by researchers at the University of Vermont, the layer is intended for planning and research purposes, offering valuable insights into flood risks and supporting conservation and restoration efforts. While not a substitute for FEMA&#39;s National Flood Hazard Layer, this new tool exemplifies the potential of lidar data in enhancing our understanding of flood hazards. </p><h3 class="subtitle">Floodwater Data Citation</h3><div class="citation"> 1.
