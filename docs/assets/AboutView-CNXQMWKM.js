Emily Sun, a planner from New York City and Middlebury graduate, volunteered as the founding Zoning Analyst Team Lead, supported by Dr. William Hegman of Middlebury College, while Colin Dowey, former of the Agency of Commerce and Community Development, acted as the consulting Geospatial Lead. </p><p> Key partners who provided additional staffing to organize and lead sub-teams included Kendall Fortney of the <a href="https://verso.w3.uvm.edu/" target="_blank">Vermont Open Source Research Office (VERSO)</a> at the <a href="https://uvm.edu/" target="_blank">University of Vermont</a>, Catherine Dimitruk of the <a href="https://www.nrpcvt.com/" target="_blank">Northwest Regional Planning Commission</a>, and Leslie Black-Plumeau of the <a href="https://vhfa.org/" target="_blank">Vermont Housing Finance Agency</a>.

ORCA creates these products through student project teams called Pods — groups of dynamic and passionate students who learn industry open source practices by working on real projects destined for public use. This program is run and funded by the University of Vermont Open Source Program Office (VERSO). ORCA’s goals are to produce impactful, accessible, open source research tools by training tomorrow’s workforce in marketable open source skills. </p><br><img alt="ORCA at Work" src="'+i+'"><p><br> In August 2024, the project officially transferred ownership to VERSO and the University of Vermont’s Open Source Programs Office under the leadership of Director Kendall Fortney, which will continue to coordinate the ongoing collection of a custom data subset in partnership with the Regional Planning Commissions, Town Planners, the Agency of Commerce and Community Development, and the Vermont Center for Geographic Information. Additional projects, like this site, will be created to explore the Vermont Zoning Atlas data and its implications for Vermont’s future along with other datasets. </p><h3 class="subtitle">The Wastewater Infrastructure Data</h3><p> The Wastewater Infrastructure Mapping project, led by the ORCA Pod in collaboration with the Windham Regional Commission and funded by the Leahy Institute for Rural Partnerships, aims to address Vermont’s village centers’ lack of public water and sewer systems by building a comprehensive town-level dataset of wastewater resources. This effort is essential for supporting housing development, economic sustainability, and future community growth in alignment with Vermont’s settlement patterns. Without public infrastructure, new development is hindered, leading to a housing crisis and jeopardizing business retention. By systematically mapping existing wastewater infrastructure data and filling gaps, the project will help identify ideal locations for new development and inform strategic public investments. </p><p> Working with partners like VCGI and state agencies, UVM have been compiling and publishing this data, supporting both immediate development challenges and broader state goals for sustainable growth and resilience. This, in conjunction with the Vermont Zoning Atlas will help to determine the capacity and potential ideal locations for growing housing. These efforts aims not only to address immediate development challenges but also to align with broader state objectives outlined in the </p><h3 class="subtitle">Support</h3><p> The Vermont Livability map is partially funded by the Afred P.
