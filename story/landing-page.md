(the what)
The Vermont Zoning Atlas is a database and web tool that brings together zoning laws from 1,755 districts across the state of Vermont. Its goal is to help answer fundamental questions facing cities and towns: for the land that we have, what can be built?

(the why)
Zoning laws regulate the types of housing that can be built. But for ordinary people, they can be complex, overwhelming, and hard to find. The Vermont Zoning Atlas takes inspiration from the National Zoning Atlas project to "digitize, demystify, and democratize information" that is often hidden under many layers of hard to parse paperwork. 

As a rural state, Vermont's zoning laws can be especially difficult to find and understand. Many towns use their own methods of record keeping and governance. But we believe that universal access to this information is critical for smart community growth.


(the how)
The Vermont Zoning Atlas began as a grassroots civic tech project run by a team of community volunteers, student interns, and a Steering Committee of stakeholders from the public and private sectors and academia.

Over nine months of work, the Atlas grew from a handful of volunteers passionate about housing justice to 36 specially trained Zoning Analysts, GIS Specialists, and team leads funded by the state of Vermont, University of Vermont fellowships, an anonymous donor, and the Vermont Community Foundation. Using a methodology published by the National Zoning Atlas, the team analyzed 1,755 districts across 209 zoned and 57 unzoned jurisdictions. 

(the who)
Inspired by Sara Bronin’s keynote speech at the 2022 Vermont Statewide Housing Conference, University of Vermont students Yoshi Bird and Michael Arnold approached the state and other partners about creating a dataset that could visualize geospatial distributions of land use regulations across Vermont down to the individual district level. Emily Sun, a planner from New York City and Middlebury graduate, volunteered as the founding Zoning Analyst Team Lead, supported by Dr. William Hegman of Middlebury College, while Colin Dowey, former of the Agency of Commerce and Community Development, acted as the consulting Geospatial Lead.

Key partners who provided additional staffing to organize and lead sub-teams included Kendall Fortney of the Vermont Open Source Research Office (UVM VERSO), Catherine Dimitruk of the Northwest Regional Planning Commission, and Leslie Black-Plumeau of the Vermont Housing Finance Agency. Significant funding for student interns was provided by the University of Vermont Geography and Geosciences Department, Gund Fund for the Environment, and College of Arts & Sciences Fellowship program.

In August 2024, the project officially transferred ownership to VERSO and the University of Vermont’s Open Source Programs Office under the leadership of Director Kendall Fortney, which will continue to coordinate the ongoing collection of a custom data subset in partnership with the Regional Planning Commissions, Town Planners, the Agency of Commerce and Community Development, and the Vermont Center for Geographic Information.
