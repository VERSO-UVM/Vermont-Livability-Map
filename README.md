# Vermont-Livability-Map

Goal: site is not a data tool, more a summary and advertisement for the work that went into the zoning atlas. Also an opportunity for feedback: where do we go from here?

Inspiration:
- [National Zoning Atlas](https://www.zoningatlas.org/) tells the story well in simple to understand terms
